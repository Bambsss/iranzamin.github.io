       <h3>Rise to Power</h3>
      <p>His Imperial Majesty Mohamed Reza Shah Pahlevi was born on the 26th October 1919, the son of the future Shah of Iran, Reza Shah Pahlavi, then a leading officer in the Qajar imperial army. Two years later, his father led a military coup and installed dictatorship, being elected hereditary monarch in 1925, what meant the end of the Qajar Dynasty and the installation of the new Pahlavi Dynasty. Upon his father’s coronation as Shah of Iran, he became His Imperial Highness The Crown Prince of Iran and was sent to Switzerland for studies, from where he returned in 1935 to attend the military academy in Teheran. He graduated in 1938. The following year, on the 16th March 1939, he married Princess Fawzia of Egypt, a sister of King Farouk.

Reza Shah Pahlavi abolished the British treaty in which Britain formally reaffirmed Iran’s independence but actually attempted to establish a complete protectorate over it. He reorganized the army, introduced many reforms, and encouraged the development of industry and education. In August 1941, two months after the German invasion of the USSR, British and Soviet forces occupied Iran. On the 16th September the Shah abdicated in favour of his son, who became His Imperial Majesty The Shahanshah of Iran.

The new Shah vowed to continue to reforms that had been begun by his father. Internationally he was know for his will of reformation but also for his personal life. On the 18th November 1948 he divorced Queen Fawzia, his first wife, who had given him a daughter, Princess Shahnaz. In 1949, he narrowly escaped assassination by a member of the leftist Tudeh party. On the 12th February 1951, in Teheran, he married Soraya Esfandiary Bakhtiari, thereafter known as Queen or Empress of Iran. Soraya was the daughter of HE Khalil Esfandiary Bakhtiari, Ambassador of Iran to the Federal Republic of Germany. In 1953 Their Imperial Majesties briefly fled the country after a clash with the supporters of Mohamed Mossadeg, but returned and the Shah formally became head of state again. </p>

<p>This leads us to another contrast: in the struggle for independence that both rulers had waged, at the time of Mohammad Reza Shah the stakes were higher and the tension greater because the Soviets were both more aggressive and stronger and also because, with the gradual abandonment by Britain of her imperial position east of Suez, the resulting power vacuum threatened the entire area of the Middle Fast. Most significant in this respect was Britain's conceding of independence to India in the late 1940s and two decades later her decision to relinquish imperial responsibilities in the Persian Gulf. True enough. the search for a friendly third force this time brought not only positive results but actually secured for Iran an ally in the form of the strongest yet most benevolent power in the world the United States. But before this alliance was concluded, there was an early tense period during which the availability of this third force was by no means certain. For one thing, the United States was geographically remote; for another, American policy makers needed to be educated in the realities of the power play in the Middle East in general and in Iran in particular. This "educational" process was not an easy matter inasmuch as throughout World War II the United States had conducted a consistent policy of close alliance with the Soviet Union and the entire American government propaganda apparatus was geared to present the Soviets to the American public as respectable allies, unjustly attacked by the Nazi war monster, peace- loving (hence proper candidates to cosponsor the United Nations), and displaying encouraging democratic tendencies. In this respect, it is worth noting, Soviet intrigue in Azerbaijan coupled with the Soviet bid to extend control over Iran's central government constituted a vital factor in the radical reorientation of American attitudes that eventually found expression in the policy of containment formalized by the Truman Doctrine of 1947. Iran, however, although thus playing a key role in the process of policy change, was a potential victim if the process faltered, and she could have ended in a position similar to that of the Eastern European satellite states. To emerge victorious from these trials required strong nerves, cool courage, and singleness of purpose.</p>
